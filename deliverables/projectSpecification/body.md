# Project Summary

The purpose of this system is to aid the faculty & staff members involved in 
curricular proposals. The system will store and keep revisions of the files 
used in constructing a proposal. The system will also allow users to email 
their complete proposals to other users for review.

# Project Goals

The goals of this project are as follows:

1) Streamline the process of creating, editing, and completing a proposal.
2) Collect all required documents of a proposal into one central database.
2) Provide version control for each proposal and its separate documents.

# Product Features
